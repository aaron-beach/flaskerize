Step 1: Setting up flaskerize
=============================

Let's assume you're started from nothing.

First, let's create a folder for your Flask API to live in.

.. code:: bash

    mkdir flaskerize-example
    cd flaskertize-example


Now, let's set up a virtual environment for our API project, activate it,
and then upgrade ``pip`` within that environment.

.. code:: bash

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
