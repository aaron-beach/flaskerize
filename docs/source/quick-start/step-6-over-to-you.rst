Step 6: Over To You
===================

Over the last few steps you've created a Flask API, and added a new entity to it.

**flaskerize** has allowed you to quickly and easily generated code, and unit tests, for your API.

There are plenty of additional tasks for you to complete now, such as defining what your entity should look like,
populating the database, writing meaningful tests etc. However, at least you now have a framework in which to
write that code, and as you add more entities you'll use **flaskerize** to automate that job.

There are plenty **flaskerize** features that we've not covered here. This Quick Start was designed to give you just
a brief taste of what's possible.

Good luck, and have fun using **flaskerize**!
